          How is Rank Calculated?
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>
          We use an adapted version of Microsoft's <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/trueskill-ranking-system/">TrueSkill</a>
          algorithm!
        </p>

        <p>
          The TrueSkill algorithm is a skill-based ranking system developed for Xbox Live by Microsoft Research.
          It was originally developed for Halo matchmaking and rankings in 2005, but because the ranking changes
          per match depend <b><em>only</em></b> on the outcome of the game (win or loss) -- and not the performace
          or actions of any players - it can be adapted almost to any game.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's a pretty sophisticated algorithm with some pretty complex mathematics involved, so go read the linked
          whitepaper if you want more information about it. TrueSkill is smart enough to handle scenarios where one player is
          performing much better than their teammates - lower skilled players can't just jump up the leaderboard
          by always playing with their talented friends. It's a long way to the top! It also works well in team games
          where it's difficult to determine how much each player is contributing to the success of the team.

          Why did my rank go down, even though I won!?
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>It's probably not a bug, but rather a rare and interesting mathematical oddity of the TrueSkill system.</p>
        <p>
          If the system has a very high mathematical confidence in your skill level and you play someone much lower ranked than you,
          it's possible for your skill to go <em>down</em> even though you won. This is because your skill is not a
          single number - it's a combination of some pretty advanced mathematical factors. It's possible for some of
          these factors to increase, while others will decrease. The singular value that is used to sort the leaderboard
          could be calculated to be slightly lower in these rare cases - but rest assured that <u><em>the system does not
          penalize you for winning games, under any circumstance</em></u>, unlike our previous modified ELO system.

          Your ranking system sucks!
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>Come on, that's not even a question. But yeah, you're probably right.</p>
        <p>
        Designing a ranking system is really tough! That's because we're limited in what data we can collect. 
        We need a way to measure performance of each player - easy enough for a 1v1 game, but in a 2v2 game 
        the role of each player is different. We can't measure the defense player's performance by how many goals 
        they scored, for instance. In times of trouble, we must turn to our old friend - <b><em>advanced mathematics!</em></b>
        </p>
        <p>Curious how it works? See "How is Rank Calculated?" above.</p>
        <p>If you've got a better idea, I'd love to hear it - really. I'm open to suggestions.</p>

          How often are stats calculated?
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>Stats are recalculated after each game, for the players that played in that game.</p>

          What do I do if I lose my RFID card?
        </mat-expansion-panel-header>
        <p>We support changing your RFID number on the profile page! However, there's a small catch.</p>
        <p>
        You <em>must</em> make this change before you play a game with your new card. We don't
        currently support merging existing accounts. This may come in the future.
