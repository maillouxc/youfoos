# YouFoos Release Notes

## Version 1.5 - 2019-09-16

Today, I'm dropping YouFoos v1.5 which brings with it a whole lot of new fixes and features. See details below.

Also, today marks the start of an approximately 8 month long hiatus on YouFoos development, as the next generations of students
will build prototypes for YouFoos v2 (and a cool new exploratory computer vision project known as YouFoos CV).

Rest assured, there are still plenty of long term plans for YouFoos and still plenty of features and fixes to come.
In order to not interfere with the folks working on YouFoos v2 and YouFoos CV prototypes, it is necessary to 
temporarily halt development on the main branch. This will also allow me to enjoy a much needed break as the sole maintainer
of the project, and I'll have plenty of time to brainstorm new features and enhancements for when development finally resumes.

If cool features come out of YouFoos v2 (or YouFoos CV), I'll be sure to take time to merge the best ones.

### New Features
- Complete UI makeover of the profile page, with a few new features too
- All the old stats are still there, plus we have added a few new ones
- Added the new shutout wins stat to the profile page
- Added a couple new stats (at the database level) for more detail about the number of games won/lost on offense/defense
- Added owngoals per minute to the profile page, plus a few other rate based stats
- Added a 5 game minimum number of games with the same person to show on the team play section
- This prevents a 100% winrate due to only playing 1 game with a person, which made the stat useless
- Implemented a play-by-play game events log, for both the game in progress and past games
- Added an empty view for when team stats are not present
- Added a button to the 404 page to return you to the home page

### Tweaks
- Added the game number to the game in progress
- Cursor will no longer change to a pointer on non player-specific (non-clickable) accolades on the hall-of-fame page
- Added one new question/answer to the FAQ page
- Changed default sort stat on 1v1 and 2v2 leaderboards to Winrate
- We now display the full RFID number instead of last 5 digits when creating anonymous accounts for new RFID cards
   - This should reduce errors when signing up for an account due to weirdness in some people's cards formatting
- We now show the user's full (first and last) name in the header bar, instead of just the first
- Tweaked the colors in the header bar to look a little nicer
- Slightly updated the colors of the YouFoos logo to look a little nicer
- Added a few new stats which are now returned by the API when requesting player stats, instead of needed to be calculated from other stats
- Game in progress route no longer returns a 404 when there is no game in progress - instead an empty response will be returned

### Other Enhancements
- Added continuous integration to the codebase - this should reduce the number of future bugs introduced
- Upgraded the web app to Angular v8 - performance should increase somewhat due to the new Ivy Rendering Engine
- All pages in the web app are now lazy-loaded, meaning significant improvements in app load time
- A few styling changes and minor content changes to the app's 404 page

### Fixes
- Fixed the dreaded table freeze bug
- Fixed a LOT of memory leaks in the web app - honestly, it's impressive that it wasn't crashing after 30 seconds
- Fixed sorting the leaderboard by owngoals
- Navigating from the team-play section of the profile page to someone else's profile by clicking their name/avatar now works
- Fix navigating to pages by typing in the URL not working
- Fix the change password dialog not validating whether new passwords match
- The "Play x more games to appear..." progress bar will no longer sometimes show "Play 0 more games" when it should be hidden
- Active header tab will no longer turn grey when the header loses focus
- User will no longer be logged out if they get their existing password wrong in the dialog to change their password
