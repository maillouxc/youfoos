# YouFoos Release Notes

## Version 0.8 - 2019-04-17

Chris wouldn't let anyone sleep until as many bugs as possible were fixed. It's been a long 48 hours. Anyways...

### Improvements
- Table: Spot claim for a player can now be cancelled by holding the start button
- Table: Goals can now be undone before they are claimed
- Added new "net score" stat to leaderboard
- Tweaked the names of some stats on the leaderboard to reduce confusion
- You can now play a game with the same people again without having to rescan your RFID card
  - When you press the start button to start a new game, the green lights will turn on
  - If you haven't changed your spot, just press your button - you're ready to go
  - If you have changed your spot, rescan your card and claim a spot like normal
  - This feature only is enabled for 30 seconds after the previous game ends

### Fixes
- Fixed undoing a goal causing the wrong score to show in the web app
- Attempting to scan a 5th RFID card after all spots are claimed no longer causes unescapable state
- Fixed time traveling statistics on recent games page - can no longer predict outcome of future games
- Rank on the profile page now no longer shows decimals
- Fixed emails not being sent when the system is running in a production environment
- Several stats now no longer show really long decimal values in the UI

### Known Issues
- Table: When replaying with same players after a 1v1, opposite lights are illuminated - should be on the same side - hotfix by tomorrow
