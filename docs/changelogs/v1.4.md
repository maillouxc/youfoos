# YouFoos Release Notes

## Version 1.4 - 2019-08-19

Another day, another YouFoos update. This time, the leaderboard page is getting some much needed love.
In addition to a total graphical overhaul and lots of behind the scenes tweaks, there are dozens of bugfixes in this one.

As always, feedback is a gift.

### New Features

- Added new "Help" page with an FAQ section - find it in the dot menu on the top right
- Wrote a new Data Remediation console app
  - This tool will replay all games as if they just happened, recalculating the stats after each one
Â  - This means if we discover a bug in stats calculations or just want to add a new stat, we can go back and recalculate all stats from scratch
- Add shutout wins stat to leaderboard
- Highlight player name when searching for that player on leaderboard
