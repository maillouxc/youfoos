# YouFoos Release Notes

## Version 1.0 - 2019-05-01

This is it! After a massive effort, and no sleep in the last week, we're proud to drop v1.0 of YouFoos.
It's not perfect, but we're all super excited and we feel that we're created something truly special here.
This final update includes no new features - it's just a huge bag of bugfixes and behind the scenes cleanup.

This project is far from done. We have a long list of plans for this thing - we want to make it truly awesome.

As of this point, the rest of the team will be moving on to other things since they have now graduated.
I (Chris Mailloux) will now be the sole maintainer for the project, and will be primarily be focused on fixing bugs
for at least the next few weeks. But for now, we're all be taking a well earned break.

### Fixes
- Fixed regression from last release - recent games only showing when a game is in progress
- Fixed several possible table software crashes when reading RFID cards
- Table: Fixed another possible duplicate goal exploit
- Fixed erroneous HH:MM values on the leaderboard
- The correct value for winrate is now showed on the profile page
- Fixed the web app only accepting .jpeg (not .jpg) files for avatar uploads
- API: Recent games endpoint will now no longer return the game in progress
- Several stability fixes and crash fixes
