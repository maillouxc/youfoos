YouFoos Release Notes

## Version 0.6 - 2019-04-10

This version marks the first fully functional system test build of YouFoos.

### Tweaks
- Leaderboard and Hall of Fame pages now only show users with at least 10 games played
  - If a user doesn't have enough games to appear, a progress bar will appear to show the number still needed
- Anonymous users are now created with last 4 digits of RFID instead of a random integer
- Scrapped the dashboard view - it simply wasn't what we had imagined. It will return later, better

### Fixes
- The first leading 0 is now ignored by the backend on RFID card numbers
- Anonymous accounts will no longer have a rank of NaN

### Known Issues
- The table gets into a weird state sometimes preventing a game from starting after sitting for a while
- Auto-login after account creation not working properly
