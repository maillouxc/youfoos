# YouFoos Release Notes

## Version 1.2 - 2019-07-16

I told you we'd be back soon! Today I'm releasing the next update for YouFoos which includes 
a whole bunch of enhancements and fixes. I'm excited to see what everyone thinks about the changes.

Without spoiling anything - the next update will include features many have been clamoring for for a while.

Until then...

### New Features
- Added game number field to games in the UI - eg. game 473, game 474, game 475 - to make it easier to uniquely identify a game
- Added trophy icon for winning team on games page to make it easier to see who won
- Completely redesigned the Hall of Fame page - should be faster and more sleek
- Completely redesigned the games page - should be much better both visually and performance wise
- Implemented a new "About" page with some basic info about YouFoos and a version number

### Tweaks
- Hid the timestamp field for game in progress
- Change mouse cursor to pointer when on player name or avatar on the hall of fame page
- Change mouse cursor to pointer on the games page when hovering over player image or name

### Fixes
- Fix background image tiling at different zoom levels on the login/register/forgot password pages
- Fix longest loss-streak stat being labeled as longest win streak on profile page
- Fix vertical centering being weird on games page for 1v1 games
